# HW #26 Definition
## Write generic class MyArray[T] with the following methods
- constructor taking amount of items (It may be very huge for example 1000000000)
- setAll - sets in all items the same  given value
- set - sets a given value at a given index (index may be ether 0 or any positive number less than amount of items), raises IndexError exception if the index greater or equal the amount or less than 0
- get - returns the value at a given index (index may be ether 0 or any positive number less than amount of items), raises IndexError exception if the index greater or equal the amount or less than 0
## Note all the above mathods should have complexity O[1]
## Write tests for class MyArray[int]
